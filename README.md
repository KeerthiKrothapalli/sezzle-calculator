# Calculator

This web application allows an user to login to the site and perform some basic arithmetic operations. It also logs the calculations done by an user and shares those with everyone other user connected to the app. The logs only show the last 10 calculations by combining the operations from all the users connected, descending from most recent to oldest. 

The development was done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and is deployed with Heroku, a container-based cloud platform as a Service which enables the developers to deploy their applications online for free.
